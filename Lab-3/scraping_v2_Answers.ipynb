    "\n",
    "**What is Twitter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter is an online social network, which allows users to post short messages/status, 280-character each tweets. Because of the continuous flood of tweets generated every day, Twitter is a great source to get rapid and current information through the web. It can be particularly useful to understand how people interacts with respect to a specific (current) topic, how they discuss and create conversations (e.g. threads) or just to keep yourself posted about what's happening around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Twitter for scraping data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last years, with the limitations imposed by law restrictions, accessing social media data through scraping is becoming a challenging task. Nevertheless, Twitter remains (with Reddit) one of the few that is still accessible and relatively open to do research studies and analyze aggregated social network data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main functionalities of the Twitter API**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the Twitter API, any developer can access Twitter data in several ways. It's possible to retrieve users timeline (the last 3200 tweets posted by a single user), it's possible to collect conversation around a topic, up to 7 days before and, as main functionality, it's possible to track the live stream of information related to a specific topic (which can be easily tracked through hashtags).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python library Tweepy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweepy is a popular Python library that helps us to play with the Twitter API.\n",

Thus, the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes* ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeness_centrality)).\n",
